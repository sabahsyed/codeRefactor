#Introduction
Given a website, the purpose was to make it accessible to everyone and hence we had to to provide additional details wherever necessary.
The layout was clear and the colors were not too bright so "title" and "alt" tags were added.
"Alt" tags were added to all the images giving them a brief description.
"Title" tags were given to all sections/headers/footers explaning its content.
